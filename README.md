# short-game-guides
Short guides to various video-games, made for those who just want to play and have minimal direction and know about missables. 

The goal of this project is to create short guides that cut out all fluff, advice on how to play the games, spoiling of minor findable items, etc. Ideally, you should be able to play the game using the guide for orientation, and as a reminder not to miss anything important or unique. Any other gameplay, findables, exploration, and etc. are all up to you as the player.
