# short-game-guides
The goal of this project is to create short guides that cut out all fluff, advice on how to play the games, spoiling of minor findable items, etc. Ideally, you should be able to play the game using the guide for orientation, and as a reminder not to miss anything important or unique. Any other gameplay, findables, and exploration are all up to you as the player.
